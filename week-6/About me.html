        A Brief Blog: Summer 2016! <p> Summertime is the Best Time</p>
    </h1>

    <body> This summer was a ton of fun. I interned at <a href="http://hollandsherry.com" Holland & Sherry> Holland & Sherry, </a> an <br/> apparel and interiors company that create beautiful textiles and wallcoverings. <br/>while there I worked on various projects, from filing paperwork, to color-<br/>ordering leather swatches for display, to photographing new products for <br/>their website launch. The experience was lovely and I learned a lot about the <br/>back end of a textile business.

            <p>I went to the beach a lot because my favorite place to be in the summer <br/>is close to the beautiful ocean. I have a great love of New England <br/>and was lucky enough to visit Newport, Rhode Island with my mom and <br/>spent a week in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Outside of New England I hit <br/>up Jones Beach and Robert Moses Beach on Long Island quite a few <br/>times and took a 4th of July weekend trip to Delaware with my friends <br/>where we spent a day on Lewes Beach. </p>

            <P> This summer I had a newfound interest in instant photography. I found <br/>my parents old Polaroid Camera in a closet and bought some film for <br/>it from <a href="https://us.impossible-project.com"> Impossible Project </a> and fell in love with how much fun it is to use. Later in the <br/>summer I bought an SX-70 camera off of eBay. I'm still having trouble <br/>getting a clean image from it, but it has been a lot of fun <br/>experimenting with different film packets, exposures, and lighting. </P>
