        This summer was a ton of fun. I interned at 
        
        <a href= "http://hollandsherry.com" Holland & Sherry> Holland & Sherry, </a> 
        
        an apparel and interiors company that create beautiful textiles and wallcoverings. while  there I worked on various projects, from filing paperwork, to color-ordering leather swatches for display, to photographing new products for their website launch. The experience was lovely and I learned alot about the back end of a textile business.

            <p>I went to the beach a lot because my favorite place to be in the summer is close to the beautiful ocean. I have a great love of New England and was lucky enough to visit Newport, Rhode Island with my mom and spent a week in Cape Cod, Massachusetts. Outside of New England I hit up Jones Beach and Robert Moses Beach on Long Island quite a few times and took a 4th of July weekend trip to Delaware with my friends where we spent a day on Lewes Beach. </p>

            <P> This summer I had a newfound interest in instant photography. I found my parents old Polaroid Camera in a closet and bought some film for it from <a href= "https://us.impossible-project.com"> Impossible Project </a> and fell in love with how much fun it is to use. Later in the summer I bought an SX-70 camera off of eBay. I'm still having trouble getting a clean image from it, but it has been a lot of fun experimenting with different film packets, exposures, and lighting.  </P>
