        I'm learning how to code because I <i> need </i> to know how websites work. I like to <br/> dabble in a bit of everything and knowing the basics of web design will <br/> help me read source codes on websites and make my resume even more <i>stunning</i>.

        Me after our first homework assignment:

        So far I am loving web design and catching on to the new lingo has been fun and <br/> exciting. It's like seeing the world through a whole new lens.

        When it comes to Github though... There are so many new words and phrases that are <br/> written out or called something strange. What is a pull request?! I click on that page <br/>and I'm like Shannon Beador in the gif below.

        I'm sure that will clear up in a few weeks though right?

        Well hopefully... I'm enjoying using brackets and finding fun <a href="http://giphy.com"> gifs</a> online for the <br/>weeks homework. Last week I was even able to understand the source code for <br/>the website for the company I work for (which was super exciting and felt amazing)!

         As for the extensions part of the homework, I installed a bunch of them but I felt <br/>the most important one was spell check. There is nothing more embarrassing than<br/> a stupid typo error and I happen to make them often. Now I can just<br/> right-click and choose "Check Spelling." It's perfect!
