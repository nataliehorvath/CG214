    <head> Midterm Project Proposal </head>
    <body> 
<p>For my midterm project I would like to dedicate a blog to <a href="http://www.saintmotel.com" style="color: darkred">Saint Motel</a>. They are an<br/> American indie pop band out of LA comprised of four members. I have been a fan of theirs for a while now and I <br/>will be attending their New York City concert on Friday October 21st 2016.
        <div>       
<p> I love thinking about the beginning of music and how it has evolved into what we <br/>listen to today. I enjoy hearing about how individuals listen to music that <br/>resonated with them. In my blog I plan to discuss the influence music can have on <br/>humans, the mood that Saint Motel evokes with their music, and talk about the <br/>concert experience and what they sound like live.
        </div>
<p>My blog will be laden with photos, videos and links pertinent to the band. I want to <br/>keep a similar style to their music videos, album covers and other branding while creating a fan website. 

<p> My three page plan&#58;

<p>Home page &#8213; Saint Motel's page&#40;a description of the band, their albums etc.&#41;
<p>Concert page &#8213; description of the concert 
<p>Other page &#8213; analysis dedicated to what makes music enjoyable? Why do I enjot <p>Saint Motel's music?
