            The first time I heard Saint Motel was at a State Park in <br/>Connecticut called Kent Falls last summer. I was having a lunch picnic <br/>with a bunch of friends when the infectious beat of "My Type" came <br/>out of my friends Jambox. The trumpets opening the song <br/>are undeniably fun and the song makes you want to get up and move!
            <br/>The Unofficial music video is my favorite one. A bunch of people theatrically dancing to the coolest song ever written??? Perfect! I can't even count the number of times I've listened to "My Type" that summer but according to Spotify it was my most played song for 2015.
