            I was in class painting the first time I heard Saint Motel's 'You Can Be You.' I wasn't in love with it the first time I heard it but it slowly grew on me and I now think it's one of the sweetest songs off their new album.
            <br> The picture to the left is of my friend Joely and me living up to the name of the song and just being ourselves after the concert. My friends and I celebrated Joely's birthday with balloons that fell from the ceiling after the concert. The concert was phenomenal and the venue- <a href="http://www.websterhall.com" style="color:teal;">Webster Hall</a> -was amazing! Below is a photo of the whole gang ~ taken between songs of course!
