            'Puzzle Pieces' is a song off of Saint Motel's debut album 'Voyeur.' It was one of the songs I found after falling in love with 'My Type' when I needed to hear more of what Saint Motel creates. The piano at the start of the song is what first hooked me. At first I thought the song was about finishing a puzzle, after reading into the lyrics the listener realizes its about plastic surgery (quite the twist). I love how light-hearted the song is and as soon as the familiar sound of the intro was played at the concert the entire venue was dancing to its infectious beat. Of course this music video lives up to all of Saint Motel's other videos. The idea of it being shot in first person is so cool to me!
